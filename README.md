The process of creating Web Components for the "Book Connect" app began by importing essential data, including books, authors, and genres, and using this data to create a BookPreview Web Component. This component encapsulates book preview functionality, rendering each book's title, image, and author within a reusable HTML structure. The Web Component employs attributes such as data-id, data-title, data-image, and data-author to dynamically populate book previews. Through the observedAttributes() method and attributeChangedCallback(), the component can react to attribute changes, updating its content as necessary. The connectedCallback() method adds an event listener to handle user interactions, such as clicking on a book preview, which dispatches a custom event. The Web Component's styling is encapsulated using the Shadow DOM, ensuring isolation from global styles. Rendering functions for book previews, genres, and authors were also created to integrate the Web Component into the app. One challenge faced was ensuring that the component would correctly react to dynamic data, which was overcome by carefully managing attribute changes and maintaining state consistency across the app. The component is used by creating a book-preview element and setting the relevant attributes to display individual book details.
